I want to create a simple python script that will take an OPML file (RSS feed list) and do three things:

1. Dedupe it
2. Sort it by genre of RSS feed
3. Create an interface that:
   - Shows the latest articles
   - Allows users to accept/change the genre recommendation
   - Allows users to delete feeds
   - Stores deleted feeds in a separate file
4. Extra requirements:
   - Use listparser for OPML handling
   - Use rich for the terminal interface
   - Show a live log window of operations
   - Check if feeds are dead and move them to a 'dead' category
   - Implement caching to speed up subsequent runs
   - Use proper Python project structure with separate modules for:
     - Cache management
     - Feed health checking
     - UI components (layout, log panel, feeds table)
     - Core OPML management
   - Follow Python best practices for async operations
   - Include proper error handling and logging
   - Use type hints

The implementation should be organized in a traditional Python package structure with separate modules for different responsibilities."
